= FIXME:

* Include README.rdoc in the website/doc (RDoc)

* Remove replication of VERSION in lib/cartesian.rb and lib/cartesian/version.rb due to parts of newgem 1.5.3 and older (DRY)

* Fix/automate the "FIXME full name" in the website email (currently being fixed manually)

= SUGGESTIONS:

* Include information regarding the memory usage (vs other cartesian implementations):
  * "Unfortunately, these methods use too much memory, storing the whole cartesian
     product Array in memory even its elements are needed only one at a time."

* Release GridSearch as a separate, independent gem. Note that 'lib/grid_search.rb' is already independent.
