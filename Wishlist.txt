= FIXME:

* Include README.rdoc in the website/doc (RDoc)

= SUGGESTIONS:

* Include information regarding the memory usage (vs other cartesian implementations):
  * "Unfortunately, these methods use too much memory, storing the whole cartesian
     product Array in memory even its elements are needed only one at a time."
     src: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/95519

* Release GridSearch as a separate, independent gem. Note that 'lib/grid_search.rb' is already independent.
